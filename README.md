# Yelp App

This app allows you to type in any location and get the first 20 listings from Yelp, including their rating, review count and a link to the coresponding Yelp page of the listing.

## Getting Started

Here is how to get started with the project:

- Request access to CORS Anywhere demo server [here](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo)
- Get your private API key on [Yelp Developer Portal](https://docs.developer.yelp.com/)
- Clone the repo locally with `git clone git@github.com:Valentino30/Yelp_App_React_Typescript.git`
- Open the project in your favorite IDE (i.e. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- Add your API key to the .env.example file and rename it as .env
- Run the command `yarn` in the project directory to install all dependencies
- Run the command `yarn start` in the project directory to launch the app
- You're good to go :)

The app will run in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the page will automatically reload if you make any changes.
